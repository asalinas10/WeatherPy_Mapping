# weatherapi_challenge

This project has two parts to it.


In the first part, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator called WeatherPy. I used the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and used problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.


In this the second part, I used weather data skills to get weather data to plan a future vacation. I also used Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API. My main tasks was to use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library and employ my Python skills to create map visualizations.
